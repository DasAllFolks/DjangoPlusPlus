# Django++

*What if there existed a C++ web framework as clean, intuitive, and usable as Django?*

## Motivation

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) is an intuitive and beautifully designed web framework ideal for rapid web development and easy code maintenance; however, [it often leaves a tremendous amount to be desired in performance scaling compared to many other web frameworks](http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/05/benchmark-web-framework) unless you undertake [extensive performance tuning](https://highperformancedjango.com/)).

This is an experimental project aiming to construct a very Django-like web framework...except it's written purely in C++.

The project goal is to produce a web framework which is...

# **Cleanly designed:**  In particular, issues of front-end display should be as strictly separated from back-end engineering as possible
# **Cleanly coded:** In the words of Abelson & Sussman, [https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node3.html](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node3.html)
# **Well-documented**
# **Easy to learn**
# **Not overly bloated with features**
# **Emphasizes developer productivity and convenience, while allowing for more advanced customization and performance-tuning when necessary**
# **Well-tested**
# **Performant**
# **Licensed for flexibility**
